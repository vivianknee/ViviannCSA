    "- The numberOfLines method calculates and returns the number of lines needed to display the text on the sign. It checks if the message is empty and handles that case accordingly.\n",
    "- The getLines method breaks the message into lines of the specified width, separated by semicolons (;), or returns None if the message is empty. It uses list comprehension to split the message into lines and then joins them using semicolons.\n",
    "- In the testing section, three instances of the Sign class are created with different parameters. The numberOfLines and getLines methods are called on each instance to test their behavior.\n",
    "- The output of the testing section demonstrates how the numberOfLines and getLines methods work for various cases, including an empty message."
