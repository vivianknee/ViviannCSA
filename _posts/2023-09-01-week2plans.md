# Java Learning Targets
-  look at JS Itunes API, JS Input, JS Output w/jquery, JS Output w/API.  Either think about improvements to each, by adding to the lessons and making cells and hacks for better breakdown and understandingâ€¦ Or, combine all the things into something unique
- Work on adding a Project, my choice will be a JS Calculator and I will add it as an independent _post that will be in Week1 hacks of my Notebook.
- Perform reviews on JS, specifically Inputs, Outputs, and APIs to be ready to support frontend on my future Java projects.

# Pair Plan
- Make a plan on what you and your Pair plan to do, this must exist by Monday and you should have proof in live review of a draft in GitHub Code history.
- Plan your Pair Showcase as well, so you know exactly what you will present.
- Code, Code, Code
- Build a review ticket in Lab Notebook, include the final draft in your Lab Notebook.
