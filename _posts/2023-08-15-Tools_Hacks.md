### My love for tools
1. VSCode (Visual Studio Code):
- VSCode is a code editor with lots of features like highlighting code, helping you finish code faster, and debugging. It's a customizable toolbox for writing and managing code.

2. Homebrew:
- Homebrew is a tool that makes it super easy to install and manage software on your computer. It's helps set up everything you need for coding without any hassle.

3. Jupyter Notebooks:
- Jupyter Notebooks are interactive notebooks where you can write code, add explanations, and make graphs. They're great for showing how your code works.

4. Docker:
- Docker is a container for your code and all the things it needs to run. It keeps everything neat and tidy.

5. GitHub:
- GitHub is where people can upload and work on code simultaneously. It helps you keep track of changes, discuss ideas, and make sure everything runs efficiently.
